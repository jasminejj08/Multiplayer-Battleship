# Multiplayer-Battleship

This work was done as a part of a Web Systems Development course. 

A Battleship game on which two players can play, implemented using a Web Socket.
The main chunk of the functionality to implement was focused on the web socket and the communication 
from the front-end to the back-end. 

After reviewing my code and discussing with fellow peers about implementations, I realize that I can
review this code to condense it and implement it in a much more structured and cohesive manner.
I also came across areas in the code where potential logical issues may arise, thus I will most likely
revise this code later on to edit and reformat it.

Nonetheless, this will work if played the following process:
1) Player 1 Joins
2) Player 2 Joins
3) Player 1 must click ready FIRST
4) Player 2 then clicks ready
5) Either player can then start the game
